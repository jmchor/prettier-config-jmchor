## my personal Prettier config file to share between projects

This is the first npm package I ever published, so it's a bit rough around the edges - bear with me!

### Installation

Just run:

```bash
npm i -D prettier-config-jmchor
npx install-peerdeps --dev prettier-config-jmchor
```

### Setup

To use the prettier config in your project, simply reference this package in the package.json:

```json
{
 "name": "My superawesome project"
    //...
    "prettier": "@jmchor/prettier-config-jmchor"
    //...
}
```
